> Use a specialized transformer, a Content Enricher, to access an external data source in order to augment a message with missing information.

> The Content Enricher uses information inside the incoming message (e.g. key fields) to retrieve data from an external source. After the Content Enricher retrieves the required data from the resource, it appends the data to the message. The original information from the incoming message may be carried over into the resulting message or may no longer be needed, depending on the specific needs of the receiving application.
