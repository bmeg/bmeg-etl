title: Allele
type: object
description: 'One of a set of sequence features known to exist at a particular genomic location. An allele is a sequence
 feature at a genomic location where variation occurs (i.e. where >1 different sequence is known to exist). An allele
 can span only the extent of sequence known to vary (e.g. a single base SNP, or short insertion), or it can span a
 larger extent that includes one or more variable features as proper parts (e.g. a gene allele that spans the extent
 of an entire gene which contains several sequence alterations). Alleles can carry reference or variant sequence - depending
 on whether the its state matches that considered to be the reference at that location. Alleles whose state differs
 from the reference are called variant alleles, and those that match the reference are called reference alleles.
 What is considered the reference state at a particular location may vary, depending on the context/goal of a particular
 analysis. A sequence alteration is a variant allele that varies along its entire extent (i.e every position varies from
 that of some defined reference sequence).'
