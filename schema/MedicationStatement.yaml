$id: MedicationStatement
additionalProperties: false
description: Record of medication being taken by a patient. A record of a medication
  that is being consumed by a patient.   A MedicationStatement may indicate that the
  patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past
  or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information
  can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a
  clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history
  taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may
  come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or
  from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains. The
  primary difference between a medicationstatement and a medicationadministration
  is that the medication administration has complete administration information and
  is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the
  medication.  A medicationstatement is often, if not always, less specific.  There
  is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know
  that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details
  such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or
  missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the Medication Statement information
  may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of
  medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration
  is more formal and is not missing detailed information. The MedicationStatement
  resource was previously called MedicationStatement. [See https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/MedicationStatement.html]
