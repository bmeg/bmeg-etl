  Related Pfam entries are grouped together into clans. The relationship between 
  families in a clan may be defined by:
    - sequence similarity (whilst still originating from a common ancestor);
    - similarity of known three-dimensional structures;
    - functional similarity;
    - similarity between their profile HMMs, as determined by algorithms such as HHsearch.
