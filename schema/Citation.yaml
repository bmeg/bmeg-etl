description: A description of identification, location, or contributorship of a publication
  (article or artifact). The Citation Resource enables reference to any knowledge
  artifact for purposes of identification and attribution. The Citation Resource supports
  existing reference structures and developing publication practices such as versioning,
  expressing complex contributorship roles, and referencing computable resources.
